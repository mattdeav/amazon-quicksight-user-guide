   To allow a user to create analyses, choose **Can create analyses** near that user's name\. To revoke this access, choose **x** by that user's name\.

   To reshare the dashboard with the user, choose the **Reshare** icon next to that user's name\. Doing this sends them a new notification email\.

   Choose **Close** when you're finished on this screen\. If you let other users create analyses from your dashboard, a confirmation dialog box appears, shown following\.
