The visual legend helps you identify what a given visual element represents by mapping the element value to a color\. For example, on a line chart, line color might represent store location\.

You can use the visual menu to toggle between hiding and displaying the legend\. You can use the **Format Visual** pane to do so as well, and also to choose where on the visual the legend displays\. The visual legend displays to the right of the visual by default\.

When you move your cursor over the legend, a handle appears that you can use to adjust the width of the legend pane by dragging it wider or narrower\.

1. On the **Format Visual** pane, expand the **<X\-or\-Y>\-Axis** section\. This is the **X\-Axis** section for horizontal bar charts, the **Y\-Axis** section for vertical bar charts and line charts, and both axes are available for scatter plots\.

1. Set the range for the axis by choosing one of the following options:

   + Choose **Auto \(starting at 0\)** to have the range start at 0 and end around the highest value for the measure being displayed\.

   + Choose **Auto \(based on data range\)** to have the range start at the lowest value for the measure being displayed and end around the highest value for the measure being displayed\.

   + Choose **Custom range** to have the range start and end at values that you specify\.

     If you choose **Custom range**, type the start and end values in the fields in that section\. Typically, you use integers for the range values\. For stacked 100percent bar charts, use a decimal value to indicate the percentage you want\. For example, if you want the range to be 0–30 percent instead of 0–100 percent, type 0 for the start value and \.3 for the end value\.
