# Working with Stacked Bar Combo Charts<a name="stacked-bar-combo-chart"></a>

The combo chart is like using two different types of visualization at the same time\. You should make sure the data in the bars \(or columns\) directly relates to the data in the line or lines\. This relationship is not technically enforced by the tool, so it's essential that you determine this relationship yourself\. Without some relation between the lines and bars, the visual loses meaning\.

You can use the combo chart visual type to create a single\-measure or single\-line chart\. A single\-measure combo chart shows one measure for one dimension\. 

To create a multi\-measure chart, you can choose to add multiple lines, or multiple bars\. A multi\-measure bar chart shows two or more measures for one dimension\. You can group the bars in clusters, or stack them\. 

Use a stacked bar combo chart to show values for hierarchical data, for example sales total by car model, stacked by car maker\. A stacked bar combo chart uses a scale based on the maximum value for the selected measure\. 

Stacked bar combo charts show up to 50 data points on the Y axis and up to 50 data points for group/color\. For more information about how Amazon QuickSight handles data that falls outside display limits, see [Display Limits in Visuals](working-with-visual-types.md#display-limits)\.

The icon for a stacked bar combo chart is as follows\.

## Stacked Bar Combo Chart Features<a name="stacked-bar-combo-chart-features"></a>

Use the following table to understand the features supported by stacked bar combo charts\.


****  

| Feature | Supported? | Comments | For More Information | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Changing the legend display | Yes |  | [Displaying the Visual Legend](formatting-a-visual.md#displaying-the-visual-legend) | 
| Changing the title display | Yes |  | [Displaying a Visual's Title](formatting-a-visual.md#displaying-visual-title) | 
| Changing the axis range | Yes | You can set the range for the Y axis\. | [Changing the Axis Range](formatting-a-visual.md#changing-axis-range) | 
| Changing the visual colors | Yes |  | [Changing Visual Colors in Amazon QuickSight](changing-visual-colors.md) | 
| Focusing on or excluding elements | Yes, with exceptions | You can focus on or exclude any bar or color block within a bar, except when you are using a date field as one of the dimensions\. In that case, you can only focus on the bar or color block that uses the date dimension, not exclude it\. |  [Focusing on Visual Elements](focusing-on-visual-elements.md) [Excluding Visual Elements](excluding-visual-elements.md) | 
| Sorting | Yes | You can sort on the fields you choose for the X axis and the values\. | [Sorting Visual Data in Amazon QuickSight](sorting-visual-data.md) | 
| Field aggregation | Yes | You must apply aggregation to the fields you choose for the value and group/color, and can't apply aggregation to the field you choose for the X axis\. | [Changing Field Aggregation](changing-field-aggregation.md) | 
| Adding drill\-downs | Yes | You can add drill\-down levels to the X axis and Group/Color field wells\. | [Adding Drill\-Downs to Visual Data in Amazon QuickSight](adding-drill-downs.md) | 

## Creating a Stacked Bar Combo Chart<a name="create-stacked-bar-combo-chart"></a>

Use the following procedure to create a stacked bar combo chart\.

1. On the analysis page, choose **Visualize** on the tool bar\.

1. Choose **Add** on the application bar, and then choose **Add visual**\.

1. On the **Visual types** pane, choose the stacked bar combo chart icon\.

1. From the **Fields list** pane, drag the fields you want to use to the appropriate field wells\. Typically, you want to use dimension or measure fields as indicated by the target field well\. If you choose to use a dimension field as a measure, the **Count** aggregate function is automatically applied to it to create a numeric value\.

   To create a stacked bar combo chart, drag a dimension or dimensions to the **X axis** field well, and a measure or measures to the **Bars** field well, the **Lines** field well, or both\. Measures in the **Bars** field well display as stacked bars\.

   Optionally, add a dimension to the **Group/Color** field well\. If you have a field in **Group/Color**, you can't have more than one field under **Bars**\.

1. \(Optional\) Add drill\-down layers by dragging one or more additional fields to the **X axis** or **Group/Color** field wells\. For more information about adding drill\-downs, see [Adding Drill\-Downs to Visual Data in Amazon QuickSight](adding-drill-downs.md)\.
