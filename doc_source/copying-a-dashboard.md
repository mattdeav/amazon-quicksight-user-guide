# Copying a Dashboard<a name="copying-a-dashboard"></a>

To create a new analysis or dashboard from an existing dashboard, choose **Save As** from the top menu\. Doing so creates a new analysis\. To create a new dashboard, share the new analysis as a dashboard\. 

After you have saved the original dashboard as a new analysis, you can collaborate on it by sharing the new analysis with other users\. You can use this workflow to preserve a production version of the dashboard, while also developing or testing a new version of it\.

Use the following procedure to copy a dashboard to a new one\.

1. Open the dashboard you want to duplicate\.

1. Choose **Save As**, and then type a name for the new analysis\. When you save an existing dashboard using the **Save As** option, it creates the copied dashboard as an analysis\.

1. \(Optional\) Make changes to the new analysis\. 

   At this point, you can share the analysis with other users so you can collaborate on changes\. Although the saved dashboard remains a new analysis, all users who have access can make changes to the same analysis\. 

1. \(Optional\) To create a new dashboard with your changes, choose **Share**, and then **Create Dashboard**\.

1. \(Optional\) To save the new dashboard, close the **Share dashboard** screen, then close the **Dashboard sharing** screen\. 

   If you want to share the dashboard with other users, you can type these users' names or email addresses in these screens, rather than closing the screens\. Otherwise, you can share the dashboard later by choosing **Share** from the new saved dashboard\.
